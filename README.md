# odin-recipes
This website is a site that displays recipes and also links to some other recipes
Here I will:
demonstrate my ability too use git and github
write html boilerplate
use tags, anchor links and image elements with their attributes
List out ordered and unordered lists
Hopefully show good commit practices
